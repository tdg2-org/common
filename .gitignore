# git is case sensitive by default

#/sim/*
#!/sim/*.do 
#!/sim/*.tcl 

# ignore everything in sim except .do/.tcl recursively. 'OFF' folders completely ignored
/sim/**               # ignore everything under sim
!/sim/**/             # re-include dirs so negations can match files
!/sim/**/*.do         # keep .do files
!/sim/**/*.tcl        # keep .tcl files

# MUST come last so it overrides the re-include + un-ignores:
# ignore any dir named OFF at top-level and at any depth, plus all its contents
